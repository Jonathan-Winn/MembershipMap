<a id="what-does-it-do" class="anchor" href="#what-does-it-do" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does it do?</h1>

<p>This is a free Python Toolbox for use in ArcGIS 10.2.2. The tool was created by Jonathan Winn for Durham Wildlife Trust, but may be useful for other Wildlife Trusts, or similar membership based organizations. The tool is used to show the type and location of members on a map, along with the % of the local population that are members. Analysis then examines a series of travel distance zones around mapped nature reserves to show which reserves have the largest local populations and number of nearby members. Statistics are then compared between reserves, LNRs and NNRs.</p>

<h1>
<a id="who-would-use-the-toolbox" class="anchor" href="#who-would-use-the-toolbox" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who would use the toolbox?</h1>

<p>The tool can easily be used by any GIS analyst familiar with running analysis in ArcGIS and formatting data files in excel or notepad. The maps may be useful for marketing and membership recruitment  campaigns. It takes approx 3 hours to produce a set of maps for a county.</p>

<h1>
<a id="instructions-for-use" class="anchor" href="#instructions-for-use" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Instructions for use</h1>

<p>Download and unzip the folder onto your computer. You must have ArcGIS 10.2.2 and a Spatial Analyst licence. The easiest way to learn how to use the toolbox is to run the tool using the supplied example data, view the maps and PDFs that are created and examine the input data.</p>

<h1>
<a id="running-the-tool" class="anchor" href="#running-the-tool" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running the tool</h1>

<p>Open ArcCatalog, navigate to the folder holding MembershipMap, expand the toolbox to view the tool "Map membership locations". Right click and open the tool. The tool is set to use a set of example data (random locations, not actual memberships) for County Durham. View the types of data being used and check the options and data locations. Click OK. The tool will run and produce example maps and PDFs. Examine these to understand the types of data created by the tool.</p>

<h1>
<a id="interpreting-the-maps" class="anchor" href="#interpreting-the-maps" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Interpreting the maps</h1>

<p>Six PDF maps and associated ArcMaps are produced. The number of members, number of memberships and the % of the local population that are members are each mapped as Standard Deviations rather than the actual data values.  This allows the average values for the Study Area to be easily compared to those areas that have unusually high or low values. Areas with clusters of members can be identified as well as areas where membership is low. </p>

<h1>
<a id="adding-your-data" class="anchor" href="#adding-your-data" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Adding your data</h1>

<p>The tool requires you to add one essential dataset (Memberships.csv) and also optionally uses one further dataset (Reserves.csv). Firstly you must supply a file to locate your organisation members. View the examples in the 2 Inputs Data folder to see the required format, notes are also provided at the end of this document. Save a copy of your membership data to replace the example file.  In order to also map the location of wildlife reserves an optional dataset "Reserves.csv" can be included. If you are an advanced user you will see that from the tool dialogue you can navigate to both of the above datasets without needing to rename or move them into the tool folder. However it is often preferable to copy and rename the files. </p>

<h1>
<a id="optional-settings" class="anchor" href="#optional-settings" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Optional settings</h1>

<p>You can alter several of the settings to control how the maps are produced. These include the buffer distance around your Study Area and the size of the grid cells used in the density mapping. A range of cell sizes between 1,000 and 5,000 are suitable for use in different sizes Study Areas. You can set different travel zone distances to customise the analysis to travel behaviour in your area. A main consideration is the use of the buffer zone distance. Larger zones will include more nearby members from adjacent areas but will also increase the mapped area and the populations used to calculate all statistics. Ideally run two set of analysis with small and larger buffer zones and compare the results. </p>

<p>This toolbox has been shared with Wildlife Trusts across the UK.  I'd be pleased to hear of any improvements or additional features that could be added. If you would like to contribute to future versions please collaborate via GitHub. There is considerable scope for inclusion of further segmentation metrics and spatial analysis to target areas for marketing or events. </p>

<p>MembershipMap requires the toolbox file (.pyt) together with a folder structure and input data. The tool does not need to be installed, just download, unzip and navigate to the toolbox file with ArcCatalog.</p>

<p>Trial Version: download from <a href="https://github.com/Jonathan-Winn/MembershipMap/releases/tag/v0Trial">here</a><br>
This is approx 300 MB and contains a working copy of the toolbox that runs for a limited spatial area of tutorial data.</p>
