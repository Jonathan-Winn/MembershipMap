{"name":"MembershipMap","tagline":"Supporter location: quantified","body":"# What does it do?\r\nThis is a free Python Toolbox for use in ArcGIS 10.2.2. The tool was created by Jonathan Winn for Durham Wildlife Trust, but may be useful for other Wildlife Trusts, or similar membership based organizations. The tool is used to show the type and location of members on a map, along with the % of the local population that are members. Analysis then examines a series of travel distance zones around mapped nature reserves to show which reserves have the largest local populations and number of nearby members. Statistics are then compared between reserves, LNRs and NNRs.\r\n\r\n# Who would use the toolbox?\r\nThe tool can easily be used by any GIS analyst familiar with running analysis in ArcGIS and formatting data files in excel or notepad. The maps may be useful for marketing and membership recruitment  campaigns. It takes approx 3 hours to produce a set of maps for a county.\r\n\r\nSee my [LinkedIn page](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonathanwinnspatial)\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
